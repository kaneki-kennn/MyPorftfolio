                        <p>Cebu Technological University-Argao Campus, in collaboration with Ginatilan Extension Campus, is developing a web-based 
                            Supply Request Monitoring System to address inefficiencies in inventory
                            management and communication between various offices, including the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), Campus Director (CD), and Budget Officer (BO). The current manual tracking method causes delays, miscommunications, and inventory control issues, which affect campus operations and department performance. This automated system will streamline the request submission, approval, and tracking processes, provide real-time updates, and help manage inventory effectively, ensuring timely delivery of supplies and improving overall operational efficiency.</p>
